        "\n",
        "In this assignment, we develop a network that is capable of correctly classifying known classes while at the same time rejecting unknown samples that occur during inference time.\n",
        "To showcase the capability, we make use of the MNIST dataset that we artificially split into known and unknown classes; this allows us to train a network on the data without requiring too expensive hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "We select the MNIST dataset and define several classes to be known, negative class during training, and unknown (not used for training at all).\n",

        "## Dataset\n",
        "We split the MNIST dataset into 4 known classes, 4 negative classes (used for training) and 2 unknown classes (used only for testing).\n",
        "While several splits might be possible, here we restrict to the following:\n",
        "* Known class indexes: (1, 4, 5, 8)\n",
        "* negative class indexes: (0, 2, 3, 7)\n",
        "* Unknown class indexes: (6,9)\n",
        "\n",
        "Please note that, in PyTorch, class indexing starts at 0 (other than in the lecture where class indexing starts at 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "We rely on the `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` implementation of the `MNIST` dataset, which we adapt to our needs.\n",
        "The constructor of our Dataset class takes one parameter that defines the purpose of this dataset (`\"train\", \"validation\", \"test\"`).\n",
        "The `\"train\"` partition uses the training samples of the *known* and the *negative* classes.\n",
        "The `\"validation\"` partition uses the test samples of the *known* and the *negative* classes.\n",
        "Finally, the `\"test\"` partition uses the test samples of the *known* and the *unknown* classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our implementation of the Dataset class, we need to implement two functions.\n",
        "* First, the constructor `__init__(self, purpose)` selects the data based on our purpose.\n",
        "* Second, the index function `__getitem__(self, n)` returns a pair $(X^n, \\vec t^n)$ for the sample with the index $n$, where $X \\in \\mathbb R^{1\\times28\\times28}$ with values in range $[0,1]$ and $\\vec t \\in \\mathbb R^{O}$, see below.\n",
        "\n",
